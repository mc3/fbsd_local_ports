manuale is a fully manual Let's Encrypt/ACME client for advanced users. It is intended to be used by a human in a manual workflow and contains no automation features whatsoever.
Why?

Isn't the point of Let's Encrypt to be automatic and seamless? Maybe, but here's some reasons:

    You're not comfortable with an automatic process handling something as critical, or your complex infrastructure doesn't allow it in the first place.

    You already have perfect configuration management with something like Ansible. Renewing is a matter of dropping in a new certificate. With a manual client that works, it's literally a minute of work.

    You want the traditional and authentic SSL installation experience of copying files you don't understand to your server, searching for configuration instructions and praying that it works.

Features

    Simple interface with no hoops to jump through. Keys and certificate signing requests are automatically generated: no more cryptic OpenSSL one-liners. (However, you do need to know what to do with generated certificates and keys yourself!)

    Support for DNS & HTTP validation. No need to figure out how to serve challenge files from a live domain.

    Obviously, runs without root access. Use it from any machine you want, it doesn't care. Internet connection recommended.

    Awful, undiscoverable name.

    And finally, if the openssl binary is your spirit animal after all, you can still bring your own keys and/or CSR's. Everybody wins.
