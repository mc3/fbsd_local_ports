This is a fork of https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko, with a patch by
https://github.com/mbr to fix an issue with known_hosts file and key
presentation order, described in this pull request:
    https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/pull/473
I created this fork because the pull request has not been merged within 2 years
and I decided to keep the patched paramiko recent (2.1.2 as of this writing). 
 
Original README by Jeff Forcier follows:
 
This is a library for making SSH2 connections (client or server).

connections between python scripts.  All major ciphers and hash methods
are supported.  SFTP client and server mode are both supported too.
Required packages:
    Cryptography

git+https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko/#egg=paramiko``.
